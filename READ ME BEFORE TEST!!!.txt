sudo docker-compose up -d --scale myredis-master=1 --scale myredis-replica=3 --scale myphp=3 --scale mynginx=1

//After running the compose file, we should go into the master mysql.

sudo docker exec -it CONTAINER-ID bin/bash
mysql -u root -p

Password: root

//In master mysql, run:

create user 'replica'@'%' identified by '112233';
grant replication slave on *.* to 'replica'@'%';
flush privileges;
show master status;


//then go into slaves, run commands below in each slaves:

change master to master_host='mysql-master',master_port=3306,master_user='replica',\
master_password='112233',master_log_file='mysql-bin.000005',master_log_pos=0,\
master_ssl=1;
start slave;

//the first-time start will cause the error below
//got fatal error 1236 from master when reading data from binary log: ‘could not find first log file name in binary log index file’
//just restart slave as below and it will work fine becasue there is no data in the database for now

stop slave;
reset slave;
start slave;
show slave status;

//Check if Slave_IO_Running | Slave_SQL_Running are all yes.
//Have a look at the error info.

//If the master and slave are empty at first, you may run:



//And then check what will happen.
