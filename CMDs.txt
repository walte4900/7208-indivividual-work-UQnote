//In that mysql, run:

CREATE USER 'replica'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '112233';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
show master status;


//Then go into slave, run:

change master to master_host='mysql-master',master_port=3306,master_user='replica',\

show slave status;
//Check if Slave_IO_Running | Slave_SQL_Running are all yes.
//Have a look at the error info.
Got fatal error 1236 from master when reading data from binary log: ‘Could not find first log file name in binary log index file’
//If the master and slave are empty at first, you may run:

reset slave;
start slave;

//And then check what will happen.
